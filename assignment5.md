*[WMATA Ridership data set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l700_7arxpO2DdcnETRzZT3ygkMIMM3U/view?usp=sharing)

**Part 1**

***Which are the five stations with more ridership? (See Tab Question 1)***         

The five stations with more ridership according to WMATA data are:
1.	Union Station
2.	Metro Center
3.	Gallery Place
4.	Farragut North
5.  Farragut West

***What was the evolution of ridership in the past ten years?***

It seems the number of ridership has been declining since 2011. Seeing the graphic trend, we can see that in 2019 WMATA received almost 240.000 more riders and, after seven years, a slight rise in the metro's use. (See Tab Question 2)

***What are the lowest months in terms of ridership for the metro?***     
The numbers show that August and December seem to be the lowest in terms of ridership, making sense because it follows the holidays and people leaving the city in those periods: Summer Holidays and Christmas Holidays. (See Tab Question 3)

**Part 3**

***The future of public transportation: how WMATA is planning to operate after the pandemic.***

It has been eleven years of declining ridership of the metro. And just before the pandemic hit public transportation hard, WMATA received almost 240.000 more riders than the year before. 2020 was the worst year in a decade, and with budget cuts and the closing of many stations, the transit agency is trying to find practical solutions to maintain the service.
