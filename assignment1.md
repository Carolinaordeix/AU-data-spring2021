Clarity and accuracy

Clarity and accuracy: 2.
This is a good piece, but it was complicated to identify the reporter’s central insight was trying to communicate. I guess it has lots of facts and data, so much information, but it was quite tricky to understand the piece’s goal. The nut graph was a little bit extensive and misleading. I found the central question the reporter was trying to address in paragraph number 4. It was not in the headline. The reporter was trying to answer the question: How do the impromptu inns affect the city’s housing market? But I am not positive that you have a clear answer once you finish reading the whole piece.
Data visualization: 3.
There was a data visualization with the title: Measuring Airbnb activity in S.F. by neighborhood and it was straightforward to read, I need like 30 seconds, but it was intuitive. I would recommend improving the visualization by adding the title “Total locations per neighborhood” and not having a vast color scale, and maybe having four colors in the scale.

Accuracy of the data: 4

I think the data was accurate. The only part the article raised some doubts, was the point of view of Wrede Petersmeyer, the Airbnb Data Analytics person, where she said that “Data scrapes are unfairly used to draw specific and often negative conclusions.” 
I guess it would help compare and contrast the reporter’s data with Airbnb’s data; that would be my suggestion. Also, maybe including some data from the hotel industry.
They used the Airbnb source at the end of the piece. The last part of the article could have been more intertwined with the original research. Not just adding the opinion of the Airbnb Analytics person at the end.

Quality
Quality of the graphics: 3.
The piece used two different graphics: Airbnb activity by neighborhood and Airbnb growth in San Francisco and Airbnb Growth in San Francisco. For the second one, I would recommend improving the two bars, including the locations, that one is very complicated to read. I would suggest using a different type of graphic, maybe. I got lost on that two bars.

Type and color (if a piece includes graphics)
In graphic 1, I think they made good use of color and type. Graphic number 2, I would recommend some more work on that, on how the reporter could structure the information visually, so it was easy for the audience to read. 

Graphic 1
Type: 5
Color: 5
Degree of quality: 4
The reporter used a red and yellow palette; while this palette in my mind is mostly used for temperatures or heat, it also transmits the message that the shader the red and the number of locations were higher. 

Graphic 2
Type: 3
Color: 3
Degree of quality: 2
From a content standpoint, there are two graphics in this image that need more space between them. And I would suggest using different colors, so you mark a difference between the average prices per type of place of residence, and the Locations per residence. Also I would suggest to re-work the titles of each graphic for more clarity. Using different typography would had help the reader to identify more easily the data in this graphic.

Creativity
Effectiveness: 3.

I like the general aesthetics of the piece, the reporter used some pictures, but I don’t think those were so relevant to the piece. I guess the first graphic helps to draw the reader in, but I would say that is the high point. I wouldn’t say this piece was super creative; overall, some improvements could help the reader better understand the information.
