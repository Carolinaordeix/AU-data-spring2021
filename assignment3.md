## **TOPIC: Transportation options for Washingtonians (Infographic)**


I am curious about how many different private and public transportation has a person in Washington DC to move around the city. I would like to see it in an infographic, altogether what are all the options (bikes, electro bikes, bus, metro, taxi, private ridesharing options, scooters). Comparing the options and I could go further organizing the data per neighborhood or ward or giving the readers recommendations.



**What I would like  to know about any data point:**

* Fleet
* Stations and stops.
* Common routes.
* Stations per neighborhood.
* Usage or percentage of people using these services (Ridership)


**Collecting the data:**

I think I will collect the data from different sources. In public transportation information, I will use open data from WMATA, from Open Data DC. In each private companyâ€™s case, I will start to see what is available online and ask for information in each company. All these companies also need permits to operate in the city. I wonder if that information could be open under the Depoptions haveartment of Transportation site. I plan to do some research online, find articles (a good source of new sources), and check Associations or specific Stakeholders like the American Public or Private Transportation.


**Table with some data:**
